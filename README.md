## Known Issues
- There is a known issue with connecting the front-end (index.html, script.js & styles.css) and back-end (app.py) components. I am actively working on resolving this issue. In the meantime, the application is currently limited to displaying the design and lacks full functionality.
- The chatbox functionality is still in progress and may not be as comprehensive as messaging platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram.
- Currently, there is no button or feature implemented to enable voice interaction with Quantron.

## Potential Enhancements for the Future
- Fix the connectivity issue between the front-end (index.html, script.js & styles.css) and back-end (app.py) components.
- Enhance the voice interaction feature for better accuracy and usability.
- Add more features and capabilities to Quantron based on user feedback.
- Enhance user-friendliness and interactivity by improving the overall design aesthetics.
- Integrate machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to enable more precise and targeted responses.
