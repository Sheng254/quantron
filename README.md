Welcome to Quantron, your personal assistant powered by quantum technology! Quantron is designed to chat, assist you with various tasks and provide helpful information.

## Project Description
- A personal project developed by myself, unveiling a rudimentary web application featuring a mediocre chatbot
- Developed using a combination of Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Comprises four punctiliously organised files, each serving a distinctive purpose:
   - app.py (Backend powerhouse)
   - index.html (Frontend masterpiece)
   - styles.css (Aesthetically pleasing touch)
   - script.js (Interactive wizardry)
- Displayed on the GitHub web platform

## Features
- **Interactive Chat:** Engage with Quantron through text-based communication using specific keywords and phrases. Quantron responds with sarcastic pre-scripted messages based on the recognised input. Please note that the responses are limited to the predetermined set of keywords and phrases.
- **Type Interaction:** Simply type in the chat box and click the "Send" button to communicate with Quantron. This allows for text-based communication and is useful in situations where speech interaction may not be feasible.
- **Voice Interaction:** Speak to Quantron using voice input for a more natural interaction. 
- **Time Information:** Ask Quantron for the current time.
- **Weather Information:** Quantron will lead you to the latest weather updates via Google.

## Known Issues
- The front-end (index.html, script.js & styles.css) and back-end (app.py) components are currently experiencing connectivity issues. As a result, the current state of the application is limited to displaying the design without complete functionality.
- The chat room functionality is still a work in progress and may not be as comprehensive as popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram. 
- At the moment, there is no implemented button or feature for voice interaction with Quantron. 

## Potential Enhancements for the Future

- Add more features and capabilities to Quantron based on user feedback.
- Ameliorate user-friendliness and interactivity by improving the overall design aesthetics.
- Integrate machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to enable more precise and targeted responses.
