Welcome to Quantron, your personal assistant powered by quantum technology! Quantron is designed to chat, assist you with various tasks and provide helpful information.

## Project Description
- A personal project developed by myself, unveiling a rudimentary web application featuring a mediocre chatbot
- Developed using a combination of Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Comprises four punctiliously organised files, each serving a distinctive purpose:
   - app.py (Backend powerhouse)
   - index.html (Frontend masterpiece)
   - styles.css (Aesthetically pleasing touch)
   - script.js (Interactive wizardry)
- Displayed on the PythonAnywhere web platform

## Features

## Known Issues
- The front-end (index.html, script.js & styles.css) and back-end (app.py) components are currently experiencing connectivity issues. As a result, the current state of the application is limited to displaying the design without complete functionality.
- The chat room functionality is still a work in progress and may not be as comprehensive as popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram. 
- At the moment, there is no implemented button or feature for voice interaction with Quantron. 
- Some python libraries used in the application rely on local execution and do not work when accessed online. Consideration should be given to finding alternatives or adapting the code to ensure seamless execution in different environments.

## Potential Enhancements for the Future
- Enhance the voice interaction feature for better accuracy and usability.
- Add more features and capabilities to Quantron based on user feedback.
- Ameliorate user-friendliness and interactivity by improving the overall design aesthetics.
- Integrate machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to enable more precise and targeted responses.
